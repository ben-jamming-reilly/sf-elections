      <h3 className="text-xl">Processing</h3>
      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Website Visit</h4>
      <p>
        When visiting our website, some personal data is initially collected by
        us. The following data is transmitted from your browser to our servers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>User&apos;s IP address</li>
        <li>Date and time of the request</li>
        <li>Requested content (specific page)</li>
        <li>Access status/HTTP status code</li>
        <li>Amount of data transferred in each case</li>
        <li>Website from which the request originates</li>
        <li>User&apos;s operating system</li>
        <li>Language and version of the browser software</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This data collection is initially technically necessary to display our
        website in your browser.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Website Statistics</h4>
      <p>
        Subsequently, the aforementioned data is forwarded to our processor
        (Plausible Insights) to evaluate basic statistics on the use of our
        website. Your IP address is deleted during this evaluation. As a result,
        the data used becomes anonymized (a link to you as a website visitor is
        no longer possible).
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim is to track general trends in our website traffic, but not to
        store or use data that can be traced back to individual visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        All data is stored only in aggregated form. This stored data includes
        referral sources, top pages, visit duration, and information about the
        devices used during the visit (device type, operating system, country,
        and browser).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find all details of the tool used (Plausible Analytics script)
        in the data policy of Plausible Insights OÜ:{" "}

        .
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Email Contact</h4>
      <p>
        Our website contains email links (mailto) that allow you to quickly get
        in touch with us. During such communication, personal data may be
        transferred to us by you (e.g., if your name is derived from the email
        address). Depending on your request, we will process this data for the
        intended purpose. We delete your requests and the data related to you
        unless it is no longer required and there are no legal retention
        obligations.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl">Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
      <p>
        We process personal data based on legitimate interests according to Art
        6 Para 1 lit f GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        The collection of your personal data when accessing and using our
        website is technically necessary to display this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The forwarding of this data to our processor (Plausible Insights OÜ)
        takes place for statistical purposes, to constantly improve our website
        appearance. The data processed here is first anonymized and then
        evaluated or stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        During contact via email, personal data is necessarily processed to
        ensure the effective handling of these requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these differentiated considerations, the interest of our website
        visitors in protecting their personal data in the sense of Art 6 Para 1
        lit f GDPR should be safeguarded.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl">Data Storage Duration and Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        We will immediately delete your personal data as soon as the purpose for
        its storage ceases.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl">Processor</h3>
      <p>
        We use a processor (Plausible Insights OÜ) for data processing in
        connection with the creation of our website statistics. Plausible
        Analytics is used to compile anonymous, non-personal statistics on the
        use of websites.

      <h3 className="text-xl">Data Subject Rights</h3>
